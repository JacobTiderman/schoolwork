NOTES:
	coordinate.h
		! default constructor is empty
		* degreeChar{0xB0) is the little o degree character
	
	EURIKA MOMENTS
		virtual deconstructors
			list needs a virtual deconstructor so fire's deconstructor gets called.
			fire needs a virtual deconstructor so coorindate's deconstructor gets called.
			coordinate does not call upon any classes with memory allocation, thus does not need a virtual deconstructor.
