<h1 class="title">CS260 Assignment 1</h1>
<h2 class="header">Instructions</h2>
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="description" -->
<p>You have been hired by the state of Oregon to create a database of fires. You need to keep track of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the fire's name</li>
  <li>the fire's  district</li>
  <li>the fire's location (latitude and longitude)</li>
</ul>
<p>You have decided to create a linked list to store this information, sorted by the fire's name. You also want the information sorted by district name. You will create a <em>doubly threaded </em>linear linked list.     Unlike the usual kind of linked list, every node will have <em>two</em> pointers. One is a &quot;next&quot; pointer sorted by name, and the other is a &quot;next&quot; pointer sorted by district. (This is a ridiculous way to do this, suitable only as an assignment in a programming class).</p>
<p>You will have only <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> set of nodes, with <span style="font-style: italic">two</span> threads going through those nodes. One thread goes through them by name, the other goes through them by district.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Do not</span> make two separate lists (i.e. two separate sets of nodes), one ordered by name and the other by district. Doing this will result in a serious loss of points. </p>
<h2 class="header">Implementation Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create a <span class="code">Fire</span> class to represent a fire.
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you encapsulate the the data, i.e. put data members in the <span class="code">private</span> section of the class. </li>
      <li>Use <span class="code">char*</span> to store strings instead of <span class="code">string</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a <span class="code">List</span> class to manage the fires. The <span class="code">List</span> class needs to be implemented using a &quot;doubly threaded&quot; linear linked list:
    <blockquote>
      <pre class="codeInText">struct Node
{
    Node(const Fire&amp; fire);		// constructor
    fire    item;
    Node    *nextByName;
    Node    *nextByDistrict;
};

class List
{
    ...
private:
    Node    *headByName;
    Node    *headByDistrict;
};</pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="code">List</span> class needs to provide operations to:
    <ul>
      <li>add a fire</li>
      <li>remove a fire</li>
      <li>display all the fires sorted by their names </li>
      <li>display all the fires sorted by their district</li>
      <li>search for a fire by name  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/regular vs. premium.lbi" --><span style="font-style: italic">This assignment comes in two versions: <strong><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/regular.lbi" -->
Regular<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></strong> (which is easier) and <strong><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/premium.lbi" -->
Premium<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></strong> (which is more difficult). If you want to get an <strong>A</strong> in this course, you will need to do the Premium version. If, instead, you will be satisfied with a <strong>B</strong>, you can do the Regular version and save yourself some work. </span><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p>
<hr />
<h2 class="header">Regular Version </h2>
<p>When your code displays the fires sorted by their district, the fires within each district can appear in <em>any order</em>.</p>
<p>For example, this order within district Astoria is fine:
<pre>
Round Bale                Astoria         46°  6' 32.8"  46°  6' 32.8"
Mosquito Fire             Astoria         46°  9' 21.5"  46°  9' 21.5"
Pig Pen Crossing Fire     Astoria         46°  4'  3.8"  46°  4'  3.8"
Little Walluski           Astoria         46°  8' 27.6"  46°  8' 27.6"
</pre>
<p><strong>asgmt01.correctOutput.txt</strong> is an example of the output that this version is required to produce.</p>
</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="header">Premium  Version</h2>
<p>When your code displays the fires sorted by their district, the fires within each district must be sorted alphabetically by district name.</p>
<p>This is the only acceptable order for district Astoria:
<pre>
Little Walluski           Astoria         46°  8' 27.6"  46°  8' 27.6"
Mosquito Fire             Astoria         46°  9' 21.5"  46°  9' 21.5"
Pig Pen Crossing Fire     Astoria         46°  4'  3.8"  46°  4'  3.8"
Round Bale                Astoria         46°  6' 32.8"  46°  6' 32.8"
</pre>
<p><strong>asgmt01.correctOutput.txt</strong> is the output that this version is required to produce.</p>
</p>
<hr />
<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
<h2 class="header">Code To Start With </h2>
<p>The code for you to start with is in <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt cs260 asgmts directory.lbi" --> ~michael.trigoboff/cs260/asgmts<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/asgmt01</span>. </p>
<p>Add code to the definition and implementation files as needed. You can add public and private members, but <span style="font-style: italic">do not remove any of the public members that are already there</span>. Also, <span style="font-style: italic">make no changes </span>to <span class="code" style="font-weight: bold">asgmt0<strong>1</strong>.cpp</span>.</p>
<p>There may be additional instructions in comments in the code files, which may contradict these instructions. In that case, do what the instructions in the code say you should do.</p>
<h2 class="header">Required Submission File Structure</h2>
<p>You are required to submit your work as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29" target="_blank">Linux tarball</a>. No other file format is acceptable. Use<span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt home directory.lbi" -->
~michael.trigoboff<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/bin/tarz</span> to create your tarball.</p>
<p>Do not change the structure of your project directory in any way. Do not rename files, add new files, or delete files. I grade your code using a Bash script that depends on files being in predictable places. Nothing in this assignment requires files to be moved, renamed, deleted, etc.<br />
</p>
<p class="header">Strings</p>
<p>For storing and printing strings, you should use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CString" target="_blank">C strings</a>. Your code should<span class="code"> #include &lt;cstring&gt;</span> and use the functions defined in that header, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="code">int strlen(char *str)<br />
  // given a string pointer, returns the length of that string,<br />
  // 
  which does not include the terminating '\0' character</li>
  <li class="code">void strcpy(char *dst, char *src)<br />
    // copies the characters in src to dst,<br />
    //
  including the terminating '\0' character</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header">Printed Output</h2>
<p>Your code's printed output needs to be identical to the contents of the &quot;correct output&quot; file(s)  provided as part of this assignment. &quot;Identical&quot; means the Linux utility <span class = "code">diff</span> will find no differences between your code's output and the provided file, when called with flags: <span class="code">-w -B</span>. This means that the sequence of non-whitespace characters in your output has to be identical, but that differences in whitespace will be ignored.</p>
<p>You are still required to produce output that lines up with itself properly. Columns may need to line up, numbers may need to be right-justified,  etc. You should look at the &quot;correct output&quot; file(s) to see what you need to do.</p>
<h2 class="header">Memory Leaks And Other Errors</h2>
<p>Your code is required to run without memory leaks. You should use <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt home directory.lbi" --> ~michael.trigoboff<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/bin/mchk</span> to check this. In addition to memory leaks, <span class="code">mchk</span> will also report other errors. You are required to fix those errors as well.</p>
<h2 class="header">Initialization Lists </h2>
<p>The constructors in your code should use an <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/101-constructor-initialization-lists/" target="_blank">initialization list</a> item for <em>each</em> data member defined by the class. Points will be deducted where this is not done.</p>
<p>Here is a class definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
class SomeClass
{
    ...

private:
    int     dataMember1;
    int     dataMember2;
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>Here is a constructor for this class that does not use an initialization list:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
SomeClass::SomeClass(int dataMember1, int dataMember2)
{
    this->dataMember1 = dataMember1;
    this->dataMember2 = dataMember2;
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>And here is one that does use an initialization list: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
SomeClass::SomeClass(int dataMember1, int dataMember2) :
    dataMember1{dataMember1},
    dataMember2{dataMember2}
{
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>An initialization list consists of comma-separated items between the <strong class="code">:</strong> and the <strong class="code">{</strong> that begins the body of the function. Each of these items is of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
dataMemberName{value}</pre></blockquote>
<p>Each item sets the named data member to the value in the parentheses. In the SomeClass constructor above, each of the two initialization list items sets its data member to the constructor argument named inside the parentheses. This is weird-looking syntax, but it is standard usage in the culture of C++. </p>
<h2 class="header">Grading Your Code</h2>
<p>Your code needs to compile without errors or warnings and run correctly. Code that does not compile will receive zero points. Code that crashes will receive zero points.</p>
<p>I use Bash scripts to grade your code. Because of this, it is very important that you not make any changes to file names or the folder structure in your project. Your project should have all the same names in all the same places as the starter project you copied from <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt cs260 asgmts directory.lbi" -->
 ~michael.trigoboff/cs260/asgmts<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/asgmt01</span>. If you change any of this, my scripts will crash. Your work will not be graded, you will have to resubmit a corrected version of your work, and you will lose points.</p>
<p>My scripts produce a log file containing your code, compiler warnings and errors (if any), your code's output, and some statistics that are useful to me. I then personally go through that log file to produce your grade. In other words, the script doesn't decide your grade, it just makes it more convenient for me to decide your grade.</p>
<h2 class="header">To Submit This Assignment</h2>
<p>Remove anything like calls to <span class="code">cin.get()</span>, that would stop your code.</p>
<p>&quot;Clean&quot; your project by doing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="code"> make x</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After cleaning your project, compress it into a tarball, <span class="code">asgmt01.tar.gz</span> using <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt home directory.lbi" --> ~michael.trigoboff<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/bin/tarz</span>. Before you do this, if you're using source control (e.g. Mercurial, Git) please remove the source control repository from your directory. This will make your tarball much smaller. Submit the tarball containing your cleaned project to Desire2Learn.</p>
<p>Please be sure the source file prints your name, assignment description and number, as requested.</p>
<p>You may upload as many versions as you wish prior to the due date. I will only see and grade the last one. You won't be able to upload assignments after the due date.</p>
